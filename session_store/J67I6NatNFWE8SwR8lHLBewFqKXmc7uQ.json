These were the two words that kept running through Sarah's mind as she stared at the empty space in her room where her grandmother's prized possession used to sit. The antique vase, inherited from her grandad, had been her most treasured possession, and it was gone. Who could have taken it? That was the question troubling her.Section 2:Sarah had always been a careful girl, never leaving her things lying around. But yesterday was different. Her younger brother had come over to visit, and she had been so preoccupied with talking to him that she had forgotten all about the vase. It was only when he had left that she had realized what had happened.Section 3:Sarah had searched everywhere in her apartment, but the vase was nowhere to be found. She had asked her neighbors, but nobody had seen anything suspicious. The thought of losing her grandmother's priceless possession made her heart sink.Section 4:Feeling helpless, Sarah decided to go to the police. She told them all about the vase and what had happened, hoping they could help her find it. They took down her details and promised to investigate. Sarah didn't have much faith in them, but it was worth a try.Section 5:Days went by, and Sarah heard nothing from the police.
