The forest was known to be dangerous, with wild animals and strange creatures roaming its depths. However, Willow was never afraid of the forest. She loved to explore its winding paths, picking wildflowers and collecting berries.One sunny day, Willow decided to venture deeper into the forest than she had ever gone before. She wandered for hours, losing track of time as she admired the beauty of the towering trees and the rustling undergrowth beneath her feet. At one point, she came across a small lake shimmering in the sunlight.However, as she approached the lake with excitement, she suddenly felt a strange sensation in the pit of her stomach. Despite her instincts telling her to turn back, Willow pushed on towards the water's edge. As soon as she reached the shore, a deafening noise filled her ears, and a violent whirlpool appeared in the middle of the lake.Terrified and disoriented, Willow stumbled backward, her heart racing as a giant creature emerged from the vortex - a creature she had only heard of in legends - a Water Dragon. The creature's scales shimmered like precious jewels, radiating mystical energy all around. Willow was mesmerized by its magic, but the Water Dragon was not amused. Its deep, bellowing voice echoed in her mind, warning her of the dangers that lay ahead.Willow was never sure how long she stayed there, but when she finally came to, she was back in her village. As she sat in her room, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something extraordinary had just happened. From that moment on, she knew that she would always be drawn to the mysteries of the forest.","last_title":"wd","__lastAccess":1679139881672}
